# Custom-Web-Scraper-And-Sentiment-Analyzer

(Python, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, TextBlob, Matplotlib, WordCloud)

A Web Scraping project I did in my 2nd year that collects headlines from the news24 homepage and stores them in a table for analysis

It involves:
- Building a custom web scraper for News24.com to extract real-time article titles and publication dates.
- Parsing HTML using BeautifulSoup and dynamically stored structured content in a pandas DataFrame.
- Applying text preprocessing and frequency analysis to identify common stopwords using NLTK and TextBlob.
- Visualizing insights via bar charts and a word cloud, highlighting word patterns across articles.
